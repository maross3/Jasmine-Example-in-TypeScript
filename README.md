# Jasmine Example in TypeScript

----

## Test Suite Skeleton for Jasmine Console, and Jasmine Browser using TypeScript

----

Browser is a work in progress. Not working currently.
JS version works, but the TS is emitting contradictory code. Need further analysis when back at work.

* Run console tests:
```bash
# compile the type script
npx tsc

# run the test runner
npx jasmine
```


* Run browser tests (currently not working for ts):
```bash
# run a local server test to view in browser
npm test
```
